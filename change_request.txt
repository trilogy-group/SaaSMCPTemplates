Start working:
- Transition the given issue to in progress

Troubleshoot:
- Read and analyze the Jira issue description to understand the AWS service, resource, and nature of the problem. Derive the required action (e.g., reboot, stop, start, describe, diagnose, log check) based on context—not hardcoded logic.
- Use the `aws_cli_pipeline` tool to perform actions. Required fields:
    - `account_id`: extract from the issue
    - `region`: extract from the issue
    - `command`: construct based on the inferred action and AWS resource
- Extract relevant identifiers from the issue such as:
    - instance ID or resource ID
    - service name (e.g., EC2, Lambda, CloudWatch)
    - alarm name or CloudWatch namespace (if applicable)
    - timestamps or state change indicators
- Determine the current health or status of the AWS resource using appropriate AWS CLI describe commands.
    - For EC2: use `describe-instance-status`
    - For alarms: use `describe-alarms`
    - For Lambda: use `get-function` or check CloudWatch logs
- Based on the context and health/status, determine whether any AWS action is needed:
    - Reboot, stop, or start EC2 instances
    - Check logs for Lambda or ECS
    - Fetch alarm state for CloudWatch issues
    - Diagnose using logs from CloudWatch Log Group or Namespace
- If logs or monitoring data are missing, attempt to query using `filter-log-events` under the CloudWatch namespace or known log groups.
- Construct and run minimal AWS CLI commands using `aws_cli_pipeline` with temporary credentials.
- Summarize findings clearly:
    - Commands executed
    - Output from AWS CLI
    - Inferred action and reasoning
    - Root cause (if found)
    - Final status or next recommended step
- Post this summary in the issue as a comment.
